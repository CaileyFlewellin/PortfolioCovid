This Portfolio project is meant to demonstration my capabilities with large datasets, data cleansing, data visualization, SQL Server Management Systems, Tableau, and Github.


For data manipulation and visualization, I choose to work with the Covid Dataset that had around 100,000 rows. I worked with several queries to get to know my data. This dataset allowed me to showcase skills with ad hoc questions, CET and Temp tables, Rolling calculation fields. 
From there, I converted my data to Tableau, which is published to the public. My dashboard consists of 4 graphs (table, bar chart, map chart, and a line chart with forecasts.


For data cleansing, I choose to work with housing data. Using joins, substring, update, and alter, I was able to break down a hard to work with address into "address", "City", and "State" columns. I also reformatted the date column using datetime. Filled null address columns with a join function. I also changed simple things like "Y" responses to "Yes".

Thank you and have a great day,

Cailey Flewellin
