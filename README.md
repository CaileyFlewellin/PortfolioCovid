# PortfolioCovid
This is a Portfolio to show case my ability to:
  1)Work With Large Datasets, this Covid Data, at the time of my download had over 100,000 rows
  2) Create Queries and answers ad hoc questions
  3) Create Rolling Calculation Rows
  4) Create Temp Tables and and CTEs.
I am continually working on improving my skills and this portfolio.
My next steps are to put this into Tableau Visualizations
